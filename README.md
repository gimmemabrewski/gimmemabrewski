# Hi, I’m @gimmemabrewski

> I'm a general contractor / mechanic and have a ton of hobbies including trying to learn coding. I'm fairly fluent with zsh but just started learning Python in December of 2021 and recently wrote my first app a couple months later using PyQt5 (although it's rather buggy, it does work!). Finally setting up my github so I can share my messy code with others 😝. Enjoy?
